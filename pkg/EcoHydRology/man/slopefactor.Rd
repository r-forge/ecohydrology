Slope Factor

}
\description{
Adjusts solar radiation for land slope and aspect relative to the sun, 1=level ground
}
\usage{
slopefactor(lat, Jday, slope, aspect)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{lat}{
 latitdue [rad]
}
  \item{Jday}{
 Julian date or day of the year [day]
}
  \item{slope}{
 slope of the ground [rad]
}
  \item{aspect}{
 ground aspect [rad from north]
}

## The function is currently defined as
function(lat,Jday,slope,aspect){
# slopefactor: adjusts solar radiation for land slope and aspect relative to the sun, 1=level ground

#lat: latitdue [rad]
#Jday: Julian date or day of the year [day]
#slope: slope of the ground [rad]
#aspect: ground aspect [rad from north]

return(cos(slope)-sin(slope)*1/tan(solarangle(lat,Jday))*cos(aspect-solaraspect(lat,Jday)))
  }
