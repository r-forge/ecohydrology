\title{
Lumped Variable Source Area (VSA) Watershed Model
}
\description{
This model calculates streamflow and approximate saturated area percentage contributing to overland flow.  It was developed in saturation-excess dominated watersheds, and is based on the Thornthwaite-Mather water budget and SCS Curve Number approach for overland runoff. 
}

\arguments{
  \item{dateSeries}{
Daily date series in the format "2013-05-21"
}
  \item{P}{
Rain + Snowmelt (mm)
}
  \item{Tmax}{
Maximum daily T (C)
}
  \item{Tmin}{
Minimum daily T (C)
}
  \item{Depth}{
Average watershed soil depth (mm)
Not needed if SAT and AWC depth entered directly
}
  \item{SATper}{
Porosity of the soil (volumetric fraction, 0-1)
Not needed if SAT (porosity depth) entered directly
}
  \item{AWCper}{
Available water capacity, Field capacity - wilting point (volumetric fraction, 0-1)
Not needed if AWC entered directly
}
  \item{percentImpervious}{
Percent of the watershed that is impervious (percentage, 0-100%)
}
  \item{no_wet_class}{
Number of wetness classes to distribute runoff over. Default is 10.
}
  \item{Tp}{
Time to peak of hydrograph (hours)
}
  \item{latitudeDegrees}{
latitude (degrees)
}
  \item{albedo}{
Average surface albedo, defaults to average 0.23
}
  \item{StartCond}{
Watershed conditions before first day of run (options are "wet", "dry", "avg")
}
  \item{PETin}{
# User has the option to enter PET values (mm/day), otherwise this will be estimated from Priestley-Taylor equation, estimating radiation from temperature
}
  \item{AWC}{
# AWC depth (mm)
}
  \item{SAT}{
Porosity depth (mm)
}
  \item{SW1}{
Soil water on the first day (depth, mm)
}
  \item{BF1}{
Baseflow on the first day (mm/day)
}
  \item{PETcap}{
Cutoff for maximal PET allowed per day (mm)
}
  \item{rec_coef}{
Baseflow recession coefficient
}
  \item{Se_min}{
Minimal daily CN S value. (mm)
}
  \item{C1}{
Coefficient relating daily Curve Number S to soil water 
}
  \item{Ia_coef}{
Initial abstraction coefficient for CN-equation.  (range ~ 0.05 - 0.2)
}
  \item{PreviousOutput}{
If the model is run repeatedly, previous output can be provided so that the model only needs to calculate from that point forward.
}
  \item{runoff_breakdown}{
The proportion of runoff that reaches the outlet on a given day after the storm event.  Can be calculated from Tp
}
}
\details{
The model expects continuous input on a daily time-step, since the soil-water is calculated over time, and affects the amount of runoff that will be generated after a storm.  
Also, note that precipitation values are actually Rain + Snowmelt (mm).  Users can use the snowmelt function to determine this if needed.
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with modeled streamflow, baseflow, ET, and maximum wetness class generating runoff for all dates.  Soil water and other modeled intermediate results are also returned.  All flow values (modeled_flow, baseflow, OverlandFlow, ShallowInterflow, totQ, quickflow_combined, impervRunoff, excess) are in depth of flow per day (mm/d)
