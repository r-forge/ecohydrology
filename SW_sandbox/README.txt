Using TortoiseSVN to grab files
Once you have downloaded and installed an SVN provider, you can grab the data from the R-forge website.  
- Create a new folder in an easy-to-find place. 
- Open the folder and right click.  Chose SVN Checkout
- You will need to change the path in the first box.  
-  " svn+ssh://PUT_YOUR_ID_here@scm.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/ecohydrology/SW_sandbox "
-  (You will have to enter your developer password a few times..)
- OR TO CHECK IT OUT ANONYMOUSLY : " svn://scm.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/ecohydrology/SW_sandbox "
- Notice that now your new folder will have a bunch of new files in it with little green check icons over the folders.  
- This means that you have the newest version of these files
