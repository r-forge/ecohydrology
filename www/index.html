<h2>Welcome to the EcoHydRology project!</h2>
<p>A collection of R packages for Community Environmental Modeling in R<br>
	<a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=956"><img src="http://r-forge.r-project.org/images/downloadbar.gif" alt="image"></a>
<br>
<br>
The EcoHydRology package was started in 2010  by the members of the Cornell University Soil and Water group as a 
collection of useful functions related to hydrology and earth systems.  
Here is brief overview of some of the functions we have already added as of June 2012:
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Radiation Approximations based on temperature:</strong>  <br>
	Since we often only have temperature and precipitation data for a site, 
	we have put together some functions that allow us to approximate terrestrial radiation  based on more 
	easily-accessible data such as daily temperature, latitude, day of the year (Jday), and geographical parameters such as aspect 
	and forest cover:
<br>
    Solar radiation, including potential solar radiation at the edge of the atmosphere, atmospheric transmissivity<br>
    Atmospheric and terrestrial longwave radiation
<br>
<br>
<strong>Modeling important hydrologic processes based on radiation.</strong>  <br>
We use the radiation approximation functions to help us estimate important hydrologic processes:
<br>
    approximating snow melt: SnowMelt <br>
    potential evapo-transpiration (PET) using the Priestley-Taylor (1972) method:  PET_fromTemp
<br>
<br>
<strong>Producing simple hydrological output:</strong><br>

    Making a hydrograph:   hydrograph <br>
    Baseflow separation:   BaseflowSeparation   
<br>
<br>
<strong>Data Collection:</strong>
<br>
    Access reanalysis of NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) output: get_cfsr
<br>
<br>
<strong>Legacy Hydrology Packages</strong> <br>

    SWATmodel <br>
    MODFLOW (in development)
